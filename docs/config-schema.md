# Config Schema

qpx uses a single current canonical configuration format. It does not carry a
schema-version compatibility branch; invalid or obsolete config shapes should be
rewritten to the current format instead of being interpreted through fallback
version logic.

Unknown keys are rejected so typos do not silently fall back to defaults. Use
`qpxd schema` to inspect the current machine-readable schema and `qpxd check` to
validate a concrete config file.
